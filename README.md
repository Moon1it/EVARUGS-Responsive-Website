# EVARUGS-Responsive-Website
EVARUGS is a single-page website built using HTML, SCSS, JavaScript. It features a slider displaying reviews, anchor transitions, and a button to return to the top of the page. The build was made using Webpack. View the Figma layout which I took as an example here: https://www.figma.com/file/7U4IltFioiIgcHA2BWsuIu/EVARUGS
